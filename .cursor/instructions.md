# Project instructions

## Project purpose
- **What:** Technical fest website/system for **Zeal College of Engineering and Research**, Narhe, Pune 411041.
- **Scale:** This is not a normal project — it will be a **large, centralized system**. More detail to be added later.

## Users / audience
The system serves three main user types:
- **Admins** — organizing team members
- **Users** — participants from all colleges (including Zeal College)
- **Sponsors**

## Tech stack
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Database / backend:** Firebase (Google)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (for now)

## Design rules
- **Corners:** Always use rounded corners. Preferred `border-radius`: `24px` / `34px` / `2rem`.
- **Buttons:** Pill-shaped buttons.
- **UI/UX:** Minimal, smooth, and user-friendly.
- **Branding:** College branding must be applied. There will be proper logos for the website (user will add them manually to the assets folder when created).
- **Glassmorphism:** Use `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` where appropriate.
- **No hover effects:** Do not use any hover effects. For buttons, use `:active { transform: scale(0.98); }` instead.
- **Scrollbar:** Hide scrollbar throughout the website completely.
- More design rules can be added later as needed.

## Features / scope
- **Approach:** Build incrementally — one page or one feature at a time. User will specify what to work on as we go; do not assume a full feature list upfront.
